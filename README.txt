test Hi Everyone
Welcome to our very own github. Please be sure to keep all your code in here and to comment when you commit changes.
Marking Requirements:
Document the system and its components

Use self-descriptive names for components, variables, objects and methods

The system’s component architecture should be readily apparent in the implementation and the code must be easy to read, understand and maintain.

It is important that the components produced are reusable and that the classes used to implement components are reusable.

The System does the component integration specified by the design behaviour tree. There should be clear evidence that it is an exact translation of the design.

Trace the implementation back to the design and argue why the design satisfies all requirements. You must establish the direct correspondence between the design and the implementation.
